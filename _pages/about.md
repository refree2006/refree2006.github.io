## About Me

Hi, I'm **Chengrui Wang (王成瑞)**.  
I am a undergraduate student (Class of 2024) majoring in Robotics Engineering at **Kunming University of Science and Technology (KUST)**. I am currently learning and doing early-stage research in the team led by **Prof. Huafeng Li (李华锋)**.

My current technical focus is on **infrared image super-resolution** : how to recover higher-resolution, more detailed thermal imagery from limited sensor data.

Beyond that, I am also actively exploring:
- **Embodied Intelligence** : perception + control for physical agents/robots.
- **AI for Science**: using machine learning as a tool to help scientific discovery and engineering systems.

I’m still early in my research journey, but I like building things that actually run — models, demos, and pipelines that produce visible results rather than just staying on paper.

## Research Interests

- **Infrared Image Super-Resolution**  
  Restoring high-resolution thermal / infrared images from low-resolution inputs.  
  Improving detail, clarity, and potentially temporal stability.

- **Embodied Intelligence**  
  Vision + control for robotics, connecting perception with physical action.

- **AI for Science**  
  Using deep learning methods not just to classify images, but to assist real-world scientific / engineering problems.

## Projects & Technical Experience

### Course & Self-Study Foundations
- Completed the **CS231N (Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition)** 2024 coursework, building a solid base in deep learning for computer vision.
- Studied fundamental deep learning concepts by following the “Deep Learning 入门” (a.k.a. 鱼书), and implemented a handwritten digit recognition model from scratch.

### Model Reproduction and Practice
- **U-Net**  
  Reproduced the U-Net architecture commonly used in image-to-image tasks such as segmentation and restoration.
- **YOLOv5 (yolov5-master)**  
  Practiced end-to-end object detection using YOLOv5, including data handling and inference.
- **Handwritten Digit Recognition**  
  Built and trained a classic pipeline (MNIST-style) to understand forward/backward propagation and training loops at a low level.

These projects are important steps where I moved from “reading about models” to actually **coding, running, and debugging** them.
